            <h3>How has software has changed the industry?</h3>
            <section class="introduction">
                <p>The time of people yelling over a giant room at each other and people frantically calling and
                    answering phone calls in order to buy and sell stocks are but a distant memory. Software has forever
                    changed the way the stock market works. The U.S Securities and Exchange Commission addresses the
                    benefits of software run stock exchanges, saying “the commission is mindful of the benefits of
                    increasing use of new technologies for investors and the market, and has encouraged experimentation
                    and innovation”. (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 1997). Today, almost all transactions are
                    done by computers, with automation at the forefront of trading.

                    Now with most of the stock market riding on the back of extraordinary complex software, it has seen
                    increases in the “average daily number of trades going through the ceiling.” (ComputerWeekly, 2007).
                    After the 2008 financial crisis, the stock exchange introduced circuit breakers into the market.
                    “These limited the velocity at which share prices could fall before a halt was called to trading in
                    the particular stock.” With this tool, it curbed the instability that came with panic selling.
                    Henceforth, in theory, making the buying and selling of stock more stable. (ComputerWeekly, 2007).

            <h3>What role does coding play in the development of these applications</h3>
            <section class="body">
                <p>According to Finance Train and Robo Garden, Java has the lead when it comes to developing
                    applications that buy and sell on the stock market, with Python and C++ coming in at a close second
                    and third. (RoboGarden, 2018). As stated earlier, the role of these coding languages is to simulate
                    and analyse the stock market and act accordingly to produce a consistent stream of profit. (Finance
                    Train, 2016). When coding is developed correctly for stock exchanges and individual alike, it gives
                    the ability to make split-seconds decisions thousands of times a day without the reliance on human
                    intervention, thus negating the chance of human error.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Why has this industry transformed in recent times due to coding and technology?</h3>
            <section class="body">
                <p>Money is the key driving factor when implementing new code and technologies. The faster a program can
                    accurately respond to the stock markets fluctuant behaviour, the higher the chance a business or
                    individual can turn a profit. As the internet grows, information can travel further and faster than
                    ever before, and with the rise of accessible high-end computing power, investment companies and
                    secondary markets can make more informed decisions and amend their software to fit current trends.
                    (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 1997).</p>

            <h3>What might the industry look like ten years from now?</h3>
            <section class="conclusion">
                <p>Technology is the centre point of the stock market. According to Business Insider, “With interest
                    rates near rock bottom, macro growth likely to be slow, and geopolitics a wildcard, investors will
                    have to rely on tech innovation to drive future returns.” (Business Insider, 2020). Therefore, with
                    much of today’s technologies relying on software and code, including the stock market, the next ten
                    years will be heavily reliant on technological innovation. “But if the tech industry doesn't drive
                    the innovation needed for stocks to continue to rise in the long run, then ‘the investment case for
                    equities over the long run diminishes considerably’.” (Business Insider, 2020).</p>
